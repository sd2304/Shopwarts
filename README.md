I have created a responsive e-commerce website using React js framework, bootstrap ,redux and HTML. The site is fully responsive and can work on any aspect ratio. 
Filter method has been used to allow the user to choose their preference for the item they want to buy. You will be able to add or delete items from the virtual entity called "cart'. Bootstrap has been used for the styling and format of the site. The site is fetching data from a fake api - https://fakestoreapi.com/
